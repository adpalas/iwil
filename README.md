# I.W.I.L. - I'll Watch it Later

An web application that utilizes web api to retrieve movie details and whether they are availble on streaming and/or web store plaforms. Successful searches can be selected and saved to a watchlist if desired.

### Prerequisites

* This application was developed on an Ubuntu (18.04 LTS) environment. 

* Utilizes Node.js and MongoDb

* This can be setup quickly by creating a subscription with Cloud IDE service [GoormIDE](https://ide.goorm.io/).
	* This service will provide free containers that contain Ubuntu and node.js pre-installed.

## Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) - The web framework used

## Acknowledgments

* Thank you to [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) for teaching me the fundamentals of web development and how to get started through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

* Decided to further build upon a simple project that taught how to utilize web api in a web application from his course. This project helped me gain more experience in building my own UI and utlizing additional api as well as solidifying the practices shown from the course.

* I also love watching movies and believe this can help me better locate and organize my favorite films that are available on the web.
